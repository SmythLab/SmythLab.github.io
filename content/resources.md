`Limma` is an R package for the analysis of gene expression microarray data, especially the use of linear models for analysing designed experiments and the assessment of differential expression. `Limma` provides the ability to analyse comparisons between many RNA targets simultaneously in arbitrary complicated designed experiments. Empirical Bayesian methods are used to provide stable results even when the number of arrays is small. The normalization and data analysis functions are for two-color spotted microarrays. The linear model and differential expression functions apply to all microarray technologies including Affymetrix and other single-channel oligonucleotide platforms. `Limma` is available on <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html"> Bioconductor.

`edgeR` is an R package for analyzing sequence read count data from genomic sequencing technologies such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq. Like `limma`, `edgeR` is particularly designed to detect genes or features that have changed abundance levels between experimental conditions or cell types. Whereas `limma` is designed to analyze continuous expression values, `edgeR` is designed to analyze abundance measured in terms of sequence read counts, which enables edgeR to be the underlying analysis engine for a wide range of sequencing technologies. Where `limma` uses linear models and normality, `edgeR` uses negative binomial generalized linear models. Like `limma`, `edgeR` has the ability to handle arbitrary experimental designs and to borrow information between genes or genomic features. `edgeR` is available on <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html"> Bioconductor. </a>
